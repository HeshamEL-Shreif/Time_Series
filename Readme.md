  - Implementation of classical ARIMA and SARIMA models for time series forecasting, including model selection, fitting, and evaluation.
- time_series_Decomposition.ipynb
  - Analysis of time series components (trend, seasonality, and residuals) through decomposition techniques.
- time_series_ETS_models.ipynb
  - Forecasting using Exponential Smoothing (ETS) models, covering simple, double, and triple exponential smoothing methods. 
- time_series_Machine_learning_approach.ipynb
  - Application of machine learning models (Random Forests, XGBoost) for time series forecasting, including feature engineering.
- time_series_Prophet_model.ipynb
